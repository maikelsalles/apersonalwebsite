                        After deciding to move to Canada, I realized it was the perfect time to finally develop my own personal website and portfolio. With this life change came the opportunity to fully dedicate myself to building a platform that represents my professional and creative journey.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I wanted to show all my skills, including DevOps, DesignOps, and interaction design, to create a seamless and visually captivating experience. Additionally, I'm committed to continuous improvement, ensuring that my website evolves with the latest trends and technologies. My website is not just a space to showcase my work, but also a way to share my passion for technology and connect with a new community.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I'm excited to share my journey and demonstrate how my comprehensive skill set can contribute to future projects in this new chapter of my life in Canada.
