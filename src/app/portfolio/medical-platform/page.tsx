                        As the Volunteer Lead Product Designer for an innovative medical platform at a Canadian startup, I spearheaded the design process, ensuring seamless user experiences and intuitive interfaces. Collaborating closely with cross-functional teams, I translated user needs and business requirements into compelling design solutions.

                    <p>
                        I utilized design thinking to innovate, by empathizing with users, brainstorming creative solutions, and iterating rapidly based on feedback, I drove the development of user-centric features. This approach ensured that the platform effectively addressed healthcare professionals' and patients' needs,
